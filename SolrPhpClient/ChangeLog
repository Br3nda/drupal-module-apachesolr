	* Apache/Solr/Service/Balancer.php: Changed default value for
	  $_backoffLimit to 10 minutes instead of 1 minute.

	* Apache/Solr/Service/Balancer.php, Solr.clss: Added an increasing
	  backoff interval for SOLR write server selection. See core ticket
	  #274.

	* Apache/Solr/Service/Balancer.php: Looking at the load balanced
	  solr's on production it became obvious it was completely silly to
	  ping a solr service on selection. Instead, we select a read
	  service at random (if there are more than one) and use it until
	  there is a connection problem - then and ONLY then do we ping it
	  to decide if we should retry the call. If the ping timesout then
	  we select another read service (if one is available) and continue

	* Apache/Solr/Service/Balancer.php: doubled timeouts on balancer so
	  I'll see less exceptions during high load

	* Apache/Solr/Response.php: HTTP 100 Continue response can also be
	  returned before the REAL status header, so instead of just
	  looking at the first http header we should look through until the
	  last one.
	  
	  the spec for ref.:
	  http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.1
	  
	  Thanks to Daniel Andersson for pointing out this oversight -
	  again, probably related to his build's used of libcurl for URL
	  wrappers

	* Apache/Solr/Service.php: \r\n added to the end Content-Type
	  header was causing problems when compiled with the
	  --with-curlwrappers options. It had always seemed wrong to me,
	  but the documentation wasn't explicit as to whether it was added
	  directly to the headers or not.
	  
	  THANKS TO Daniel Andersson for finding this bug, since our php
	  build is not compiled with this options and we never would have
	  found it ourselves.

	* Apache/Solr/Response.php, Apache/Solr/Service.php, Solr.clss:
	  Using the json.nl parameter instead of mapping namedLists with my
	  own code. Added getters / setters for optional enhancements.

2007-10-19 16:42  djimenez

	* Apache/Solr/Response.php, Apache/Solr/Service.php: Added extra
	  options to Apache_Solr_Response to allow the turning off of
	  special "corrections" we do to the json response. In cases where
	  this isn't needed OR isn't desired it can be a small speed boost.
	  Changed the implementation of Apache_Solr_Service::search to use
	  http_build_query - had to combine it with a preg_replace, but
	  this is still significantly faster than doing all the urlencoding
	  ourselves in a loop written in PHP.

	* Apache/Solr/Document.php, Apache/Solr/Response.php,
	  Apache/Solr/Service.php, Apache/Solr/Service/Balancer.php: Added
	  ability to keep Response object from creating documents (can save
	  a little time when you don't need them). Also, updated the
	  balancer so that it will try other services during a
	  communication error on a call.

	* Apache/Solr/Response.php: Missed changing the package /
	  subpackage pair. refs #29

2007-10-02 02:52  djimenez

	* Apache/Solr/Service.php: Got rid of the const defined defaults
	  for host, port and path. Now defined within the constructor
	  signature so its easier to override in a subclass

2007-09-28 22:40  djimenez

	* Apache/Solr/Document.php, Apache/Solr/Response.php,
	  Apache/Solr/Service, Apache/Solr/Service.php,
	  Apache/Solr/Service/Balancer.php,
	  trunk/application/cit5_solr/start.inc: Add the
	  Apache_Solr_Service_Balancer ref. implementation for selecting
	  from multiple read or write solr instances (such as in a
	  replicated solr environment). Made the ping function of Service
	  more useful and faster. stopped ignoring when we couldn't talk to
	  a server (now throws a communication error exception). refs #29

2007-09-24 22:17  djimenez

	* Apache, Apache/Solr, Apache/Solr/Document.php,
	  Apache/Solr/Response.php, Apache/Solr/Service.php,
	  Solr/Document.php, Solr/Response.php, Solr/Service.php,
	  trunk/application/cit5_solr/start.inc: been suggested by
	  community to change class namespace to Apache_Solr... have kept
	  subclasses for backwards compatibility with code we have already
	  
	  need config constants for now
	  
	  closes #10, #16
